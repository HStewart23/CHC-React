## _What is Water me all about?_

### So...There is an empty flower pot.

* User must hit the **Water Me** to continuously water the plant.
* For every **3 points** a part of the plant stalk will appear 
* For every **10 points** a leaf will appear on the stalk 
(_think of Tetris_)

* Once the user has clicked **29 times** the flower head will appear and the game would have been completed.

#### Our api call would show ‘Game over’

## _What is your Persistent state?_
* There will be a timer running
* After every **3 seconds** the counter will **-3** from the total points, so the user has be make sure they are clicking with _speed!_
* If the user does not click the points will eventually all be deducted and the plant will die.


## Do we have tests?
*Yesssss Weee DO!*
* ✨We check to see if the toggle Start >< Reset functions ✨

# Thanks for Watering Me!
